                <h1>The Mystery of the <strong>Júnior Barranquilla</strong> Logo in PES Games</h1>
            </article>

        <article>
         <h2>Nostalgia and Game Selection</h2>
            <p>A Brazilian player driven by nostalgia was playing PES 2011,
        While navigating the menu, a different logo for <strong>Júnior Barranquilla</strong> is discovered.</p>
        <picture>
            <img class="logo" src="./img/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_2011_Logo.png" alt="">
        </picture>

         <h2>Analyzing the Logo Differences</h2>
            <p>A screenshot is taken and the logo is vectorized for analysis.
        Key differences emerge: the blue part of the logo appears as a separate “hat” in PES 2011, while in later versions, it’s integrated as a border.</p>
            <p>The number of stars on the logo reflects championship titles. PES 2011 features five stars; PES 2012 shows six, due to another title win.
        This use of stars is common among South American, especially Colombian, clubs.</p>
            <p> To confirm if the logo was ever officially used, historical team jerseys are reviewed.
        Despite deep searches in the Football Kit Archive, there’s no record of this specific logo being officially adopted by Júnior Barranquilla.</p>
            <p>Using image search tools like TinEye, the earliest known appearance of this logo online is traced back to February 7, 2008.</p>

            <h1>Exploring the Mystery of <strong>Atlético Júnior's</strong></h1>
            <h2>The Inactive Logo Discovery</h2>
            <p>The logo in question was uploaded on October 17, 2008, labeled as “Atlético Júnior Old,” implying it was already outdated at the time.
        This raises questions, as it appears in PES 2010 despite supposedly being inactive.</p>
            <p> A Pinterest profile shows a low-resolution image titled “Júnior de Barranquilha, 1995.”
        It includes five stars, meaning it must date between late 2004 and mid-2010 (Júnior’s fourth title came in 1995).</p>
            <p>Attempts to find early information on the club’s official website via the Wayback Machine fail; no records appear before 2019.
        Facebook archives only go back to late 2015, which reflects how difficult it is to track club communications from the pre-social media era.</p>
            <p>A childhood book titled Escudos dos times do mundo inteiro becomes a vital source in the investigation.
        It features an entry for Atlético Júnior showing the logo found in PES 2011, proving its existence predates online records.</p>
            <p>The book features a unique version of the logo with ten stars—five inside the shield and five above it.
        This design repeats the same information but offers an interesting design perspective.</p>
            <p>A football logo blog is contacted, but they have no knowledge of the mysterious logo.
        Rodolfo Rodriguez, the author of the book, is approached for clarification. This leads to exploring various archives, including an abandoned Danish site called HQFl.</p>

            <h1>Investigating the Mystery of a Football Club Logo</h1>
            <h2>The Search for the Logo</h2>
            <p>The site “Brands of the World” is checked, but the desired logo isn’t found.
        The Wayback Machine reveals a corrupted image of a logo uploaded in March 2000, but it’s unusable.
        Because it predates the club’s fifth star in 2004, it’s deemed an incorrect version.</p>
            <p>Rodolfo Cussarev is mentioned as a potential source, but there’s no response via Instagram.
        Frustration grows over the lack of reliable information regarding the logo.</p>
            <p>Questions arise about whether the logo was ever officially used, especially given Júnior Barranquilla’s status as a major Colombian club.
        Attempts to contact the club via Instagram and Facebook go unanswered.</p>
            <p>A list of 108 sources from the book is examined, leading to a detailed search of outdated football logo websites.
        This reveals the mysterious logo was widely available online around 2005.</p>
            <p>A breakthrough comes via the Liga Colombiana website, which shows the correct logo featuring only four stars—consistent with the title count at that time.
        An old domain of Júnior's official site also surfaces, confirming the club's true emblem and exposing differences with other versions.</p>
            <p>Outreach on social media eventually yields help from Fred Edu 96 on Pinterest.
        Fred’s TikTok account provides more logo examples, although discrepancies in dates and usage remain.</p>

            <h1> What is the Official Logo of <strong>Júnior Barranquilla?</strong></h1>
            <h2> Discovery of the Museum and Initial Inquiry</h2>
            <p>The Rorri Blanco Museum, dedicated to Júnior Barranquilla, is found and contacted.
        Their research shows that many logos circulating online were never officially used by the club.</p>
            <p>Júnior Barranquilla has undergone eight major logo changes, not including versions with additional stars.
        The PES 2011 logo is identified as unofficial, likely created between 1995 and 2004, but misrepresented as official online.</p>
            <p>A Konami employee mistakenly used the wrong logo due to its online presence, leading to its appearance in PES 2011.
        This case mirrors other situations where teams are misrepresented due to inaccurate online resources.</p>
